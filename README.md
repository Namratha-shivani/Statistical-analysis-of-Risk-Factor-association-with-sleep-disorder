The primary objective of this study is to investigate the relationships between key lifestyle factors and the occurrence of sleep disorders. Additionally, the study aims to explore how these lifestyle factors are associated with sleep duration, with a particular focus on variables such as physical activity and stress level.


## Hypotheses:
Null Hypothesis (H0): Various factors, including age, gender, occupation, physical activity, and stress level, do not have a statistically significant impact on the presence of sleep disorders.

Alternative Hypothesis (HA): Various factors, including age, gender, occupation, physical activity, and stress levels, have a statistically significant impact on the presence of sleep disorders.

## CONCLUSION:
- In our exploration of the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset, our statistical analysis aimed to uncover relationships between various factors and the presence of sleep disorders among a sample of 400 adult.
- Utilizing ANOVA, we revealed overall trends in sleep disorder prevalence across different groups. Pairwise t-tests complemented this by delving into specific pairwise comparisons, allowing us to identify significant differences between groups and confirm main effects observed in ANOVA.
- The identification of main effects associated with age, gender, stress level, and sleep duration provided a foundational understanding of their impact on sleep disorders. Notably, recognizing interaction effects highlighted nuanced relationships.
- Addressing multicollinearity in our regression model became crucial for untangling the independent effects of predictor variables. Furthermore, considering interaction terms enhanced the model's ability to capture intricate relationships, especially when certain variables moderated the impact of others.
- In conclusion, analysis provides valuable insights into the complex landscape of sleep health and lifestyle factors. These findings not only confirm significant relationships but also reveal the subtleties of interactions.
